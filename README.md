### Running the code
For training biologically-plausible networks using the modified-Full-Force, run "main.m" within the Section3.6 folder.

For use of excitatory neurons only during training, run "FULLFORCE.m" within Section3.5 folder.

For graph theoretic experiments, run the Jupyter Notebook within Section3.1 folder.
